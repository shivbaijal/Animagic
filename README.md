Animagic
========

**Easily prototype iOS animations**

Quickly find the perfect animation, without having to manually change values in your code every time. 

All animations are previewed by a graph, so it's easy to understand what impact the values have, even before you see the full animation.

## Usage
Simply download the zip, install the pods, open Xcode, and build it to your phone.

Swipe horizontally to switch between the curve editing and frame editing cards.
Swipe vertically to show/hide the cards.
Tap the screen to begin the animation you just created!

## TODO
- Customizable Bezier Curves
- Save Multiple Animations
- iPad App Support
